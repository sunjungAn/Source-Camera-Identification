# Abstract



present a DenseNet pipeline to solve the problem of identifying the source camera-model of an image.

proposed pipeline is suit-able for other image-forensic classification tasks.



# 1. Introduction

+ metadata of the digital image is **unavailable** â†’ a forensic analyst as to implement unique techniques to determine the source camera model solely from an image

+ focus has sifted toward detecting intrinsic camera features

  + CFA pattern
  + IQM

  + PRNU
