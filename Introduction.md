# Introduction

techniques based on artificial intelligence such as GAN that can be exploited by malicious actors to spread "fake news"

In order to verify the authenticity and integrity of a digital image, a number of techniques, known collectively as "digital image forensics"



**"where is this digital image from?"**

1. source camera identification
2. recaptured image forensic
3. computer graphics image forensic
4. GAN-generated image detection
5. source social network identification



CNNs have been shown to be effective when dealing with image-related tasks, and have been subsequently adopted as a basis for numerous digital image forensics methods.



### object

did our best to collect all the related paper which have been published in journals, conferences, and arXiv. We observed that all of them have some common modules, and we proposed a unifying framework where all these schemes fit, thus simplifying their comparison.



### Classification

+ classification of a single patch
  + by having a softmax layer
  + by training a separate classfier on the features extracted
+ no single method is using all those techniques



### reviewed algorithm

1. adoption of traditional CNN
2. data enhancement (including data augmentation)
3. fusion and ensemble
4. means of patch selection
5. adoption of different classifiers
